# PEPP - PYLON Exporter++

<sub><sup>V2.3.0 [Changelog](https://github.com/haganbt/pepp/wiki/Changelog)</sup></sub>

PEPP is a utility for exporting data from DataSift's PYLON product in either JSON or CSV format, optionally saving the data to local file. PEPP also supports the ability to automatically generate Tableau workbooks and comes equipped with a number of use case driven examples out of the box.

It is the goal of this utility to support any type of analysis requests using a config (not code) approach.

Features:

 * Simplified JSON config "recipe" approach
 * Export as JSON or CSV
 * Support for ```analyze``` and ```task``` api resources
 * Multi-index query
 * Result set merging
 * Result set to query inheritance
 * Request queue with concurrency limit
 * Retry logic to handle API errors
 * Automated Tableau workbook generation

### DISCLAIMER: This library is in no way associated with or supported by DataSift and hence any questions or issues issues should be logged [here](https://github.com/haganbt/pepp/issues).

# Quick Start

* Edit ```config/demo.js``` and add values for the PYLON recording id along with authentication credentials.
* Run PEPP with the command ```node app.js```

# User Guide

PEPP uses a configuration file to define request tasks. Files can be configured as JSON, YAML, hjson, JSON5, CoffeeScript etc (see ```/config``` for examples of JSON and YAML). Each task defines a request to the PYLON ```/analyze``` resource. With this is mind, usage requires 3 steps:

* Define request tasks within a config file
* Tell PEPP which config file to use
* Run tasks


## Config File Structure

The config file contains an ```analysis``` object consisting of two arrays: ```freqDist``` and ```timeSeries```. Tasks (i.e. an analysis request to PYLON) are simply defined by specifying 
an object ```{ ... }``` within the desired request type array. The below example defines a single task for both a ```freqDist``` and ```timeSeries```. Note depending upn which request type is being run, PYLON
mandates specific key:values be present:

```json
  "analysis": {
    "freqDist": [
      {
        target: "fb.author.gender"
      }
    ],
    "timeSeries": [
      {
        interval: "day"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Single Task

As noted above, to make a single request, define a single task object inside the required type array (```freqDist``` or ```timeSeries```):

```json
    "freqDist": [
      {
        "target": "fb.author.gender"
      }
]
```


### Native Nested Tasks

PYLON supports nesting of low cardinality targets up tot 3 levels deep. PEPP supports these using the ```child``` key:

```json
{
    "name": "example_native_nested",
    "target": "fb.author.gender",
    "threshold": 2,
    "child": {
        "target": "fb.author.age",
        "threshold": 2,
        "child": {
            "target": "fb.media_type",
            "threshold": 2
        }
    }
}   
```


### Custom Nested

Custom nested tasks offer increased flexibility over native nested tasks by adding support for all targets (native nested tasks are currently restricted to low cardinality targets only).

The workflow for custom nested tasks is simple in that each result key from a primary task is used to generates subsequent secondary tasks by using the key as a ```filter``` parameter.

Custom nested tasks are configured within the config file using the ```then``` object:

```json
"freqDist": [
    {
        "target": "fb.topics.name",
        "threshold": 2,
        "then": {  // <-- then object defines custom nested
            "target": "fb.author.gender",
            "threshold": 2
        }
    }
]
```

### Mixing Nested Task Types

It is possible to specify a custom nested task containing a native nested task. For example: 

```json
{
    "target": "fb.parent.topics.name",
    "threshold": 25,
    "then": {  // <-- custom nested
      "target":"fb.parent.author.region",
      "threshold": 20,
        "child": {  // <-- native nested
          "target": "fb.parent.author.gender",
          "threshold": 2,
          "child": {
            "target": "fb.parent.author.region",
            "threshold": 50
          }
        }
      }
  }
```

As with any custom nested query, this will dynamically generate a ```filter``` property and next query (the 3 level native nested) from the result keys returned from the first task. 

NOTE: Native nested followed by custom nested is not currently supported. 


### Merged Tasks

Multiple tasks can be merged together to deliver a single combined result set. Simply wrap the tasks in an array object. Note the task ```name``` is set using the array key: 

```json
"freqDist": [
    {
        "merged__example": [ // <-- Task name
            {
                task 1...
            },
            {
                task 2...
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Analysis Tags

Analysis Tags provide freedom to define custom filters as part of analysis tasks. Each Analysis Tag can be defined and then referenced and reused throughout a config recipe.

This technique is especially useful for data sets where VEDO is unavailable, or required tags have been omitted or were unknown at the time of recording.

Analysis tags are simply config defined filters that can then be used within a task definition in place of a ```target``` and ```threshold```.

Analysis Tags are defined at the config parent level using an ```analysisTags``` key and then referenced from within each task using the ```analysis_tag``` key.

Consider the below example where custom filters have been defined for characters and US areas. These are defined within the ```analysisTags``` key. Each of the Analysis Tags are then referenced as part of a freqDist task:



```json
"analysisTags": {
    "character": [ //<-- name to identify analysis_tag family
        {
            "key": "yogi",
            "filter": "fb.all.content contains_any \"yogi\""
        },
        {
            "key": "booboo",
            "filter": "fb.all.content contains_any \"booboo\""
        }
    ],
    "us_areas": [  //<-- second analysis_tag family
        {
            "key": "New England",
            "filter": "fb.author.country in \"United States\" and fb.author.region in \"Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut\""
        },
        {
            "key": "Pacific",
            "filter": "fb.author.country in \"United States\" and fb.author.region in \"Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington\""
        }
    ]
},
"analysis": {
    "freqDist": [
        {
            "name": "example-fd-task_tag",
            "analysis_tag": "character",  //<-- reference analysis_tag family
            "then": {
                "analysis_tag": "us_areas",  //<-- reference analysis_tag family
                "then": {
                    "target": "fb.topics.name",
                    "threshold":2
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Example output:

```
key1,key2,key3,interactions,unique_authors
yogi,New England,Birthday,100,100
yogi,Pacific,Birthday,300,300
booboo,New England,Birthday,600,600
booboo,Pacific,Birthday,1600,1600
```

Analysis Tags can be used anywhere a regular target would be used, with the exceptions of at any level of a Native Nested task, or the bottom-most level in any other task.


## Config File Selection

### Config File Selection by Environment Variable

To specify which config file to use, set the ```NODE_ENV``` environment variable:

On a Mac:
```export NODE_ENV=myConfigFile```

On a Windows machine:
```set NODE_ENV=myConfigFile```

NOTE: only specify the config file name. Omit the filetype extension, i.e. ```.json```

If ```NODE_ENV``` is not specified, the ```demo``` config file will be used i.e.load the ```/config/demo.js```
config file.

### Config File Selection by Commandline Argument

Alternatively, the filename may be specified by the first commandline argument to the app:

```
node app.js myConfigFile
```

### Config File Directory

The directory from which config files are loaded can be set by defining the ```NODE_CONFIG_DIR``` environment variable. This can be a full path from your root directory, or a relative path from the process if the value begins with ```./``` or ```../```.

### api_resource Property

The ```api_resource``` property identifies if either the ```analyze``` or ```task``` api resource will be used for tasks. This property can be set in three different ways depending upon the required behavior.

1. ```app.api_resource``` - Sets the default api resource for all tasks.
2. ```index.<my_index>.api_resource``` - Set the default api resource for all tasks using the specific index.
3. ```api_resource``` - Set the default api resource for a specific task. Custom nested tasks will inherit this value if set.


NOTE: If more than one of the above is set, the override order is as per the above order i.e. ```app``` is overriden by ```index``` which is overridden by individual tasks.


### Filter Property

A ```filter``` parameter can be set in 3 places within PEPP: 

1. global - apply a filter to all tasks within the config file
2. task - apply a filter to a specific task
3. custom nested child - apply a filter to a custom nested child task


If any of the above options are set in conjunction with each other, each will simply augment the next joining with an ```AND```. Examples of each type are below.


#### Global Filter

Specifying a global ```filter``` parameter will apply the filter to all tasks within the config file (including custom nested child tasks - see below). Example:

```json
{
    "filter": "interaction.tag_tree.property ==\"Yogi\"",
    "analysis": {
        "freqDist": [
            .....
}

```


#### Task Filter

A task level filter can be set as expected:


```json
{
    "filter": "interaction.tag_tree.property ==\"Yogi\"",
    "threshold": 2,
    "target": "fb.author.gender"
}

```


**Custom Nested**

In cases where a filter is set within a custom nested task, all child tasks automatically inherit the parent ```filter``` property from the parent task. Consider the following config:

```json
"freqDist": [
    {
        "filter": "fb.all.content any \"Yogi\"",
        "target": "fb.author.gender",
        "threshold": 2,
        "then": {
            "target": "fb.topics.name",
            "threshold": 3,
        }
    }
}

```

Both the ```gender``` and the subsequent ```topics``` tasks will all have the "Yogi" filter appended. 


#### Custom Nested Child Filter

It is also possible to specify a filter as part of a custom child task as follows:

```json
"freqDist": [
    {
        "filter": "fb.all.content any \"Yogi\"",
        "target": "fb.author.gender",
        "threshold": 2,
        "then": {
            "filter": "fb.all.content any \"Booboo\"", //<-- child filter
            "target": "fb.topics.name",
            "threshold": 3,
        }
    }
}

```

Once again, the filter parameters are simply augmented together. In the above example the ```gender``` task with have the "Yogi" filter applied and all child tasks with have both the "Yogi" and "Booboo" filters applied together e.g: 

```json
"filter":"(fb.author.gender == \"female\") AND (fb.all.content any \"Yogi\") AND (fb.all.content any \"Booboo\")""
```

NOTE: Setting the ```log_level``` to ```debug`` will show the requests being generated, including the ```filter```.


### Start/End Properties

Optional ```start``` and ```end``` unix timestamp properties can be set globally (apply to all tasks) or at a specific task level to specify the time range for analysis queries. If both are set, the task will override the global setting.

In addition, if you are using a JavaScript config file (rather than JSON or YAML), you can use any JavaScript date library for simper configuration. For example, using moment.js:

```javascript
"use strict";

const moment = require('moment');

module.exports = {
    start: moment.utc().subtract(7, 'days').unix(),
    ...
```

### Execution Groups

When the ```group``` property is assigned on a task, it defines all tasks labeled with the same group value as a set. These groups can be useful when your recipe file has multiple logical groups of tasks that are often run together. For example, all tasks associated with brand monitoring vs. those for content monitoring, or when running all tasks in your recipe would exceed your hourly analyze limit.

At runtime, the group to be executed may be specified on the commandline:

```
node app.js myrecipe mygroup
```

or via the ```PEPP_GROUP``` environment variable:

```
export PEPP_GROUP=mygroup
```

The ```skip``` and ```only``` properties may also be used in conjunction with the execution group functionality. In the context of a single group, if a task is designated as ```only```, other tasks in the group without this flag will not be executed. When ```skip``` is used, the identified task will not be executed in the context of the group. NOTE: When no group is specified, the group context does not apply, and any task with ```only``` specified will be executed from the recipe.

## Index Credentials

One or more PYLON idexes must be defined by setting a parent ```index``` key. Credentials defined under the ```default```
key will be used unless overridden by setting an ```index``` parameter. The default analyze URI can also be overwritten 
to support a proxy:


```json
module.exports = {
   "index": {
     "default": {
       "subscription_id": "<RECORDING_ID>",
       "auth": {
         "username": "<USERNNAME>",
         "api_key": "<API_KEY>"
       }
     },
     "foo": {
       "analyze_uri": "https://pylonsandbox.datasift.com/v1/pylon/analyze", //<-- override analyze URI
       "subscription_id": "<RECORDING_ID>",
       "auth": {
         "username": "<USERNNAME>",
         "api_key": "<API_KEY>"
       }
     }
   },
   "analysis": {
     "freqDist": [
       {
         "index": "foo", //<-- override default creds
         "target": "fb.author.age",
         "threshold": 2
       },
       {
         "target": "fb.author.age",
         "threshold": 2
       }
     ]
   }
 };
```

**Custom Nested Tasks**

If an ```index``` key is set as part of a parent custom nested task, the child task will inherit these values.

```json
{
    "index": "foo",
    "target": "fb.author.gender",
    "threshold": 2,
    "then": {
        "target": "fb.type", //<-- inherits "foo" creds
        "threshold": 2
    }
}
```


## Demographic Baselines

PEPP supports baseline and microtargeting use cases by automatically calculating 1 or more probability comparators against a baseline data set.

NOTE: Currently, PEPP only supports age and gender targets for baseline comparisons. A baseline task can be created as follows:

**1) Name the merged tasks**
 
The merged task name must include the string "baseline" to trigger the baseline calculation workflow:

```json
 "freqDist": [
    {
        "merged_baseline_example": [ // <-- name must include "baseline"
            {
                task 1...
            },
            {
                task 2...
            }
        ]
    }
]    
```

**2) Create age/gender tasks**

Tasks can be age gender (or gender age, no difference) however all tasks must be identical i.e. if one task uses age and gender others should not use gender and age:

```json
 "freqDist": [
    {
        "merged_baseline_example": [
            {
                "target": "fb.parent.author.age",
                "threshold": 6,
                "child": {
                    "target": "fb.parent.author.gender",
                    "threshold": 2
                }
            },
            {
                "target": "fb.parent.author.age",
                "threshold": 6,
                "child": {
                    "target": "fb.parent.author.gender",
                    "threshold": 2
                }
            },
        ]
    }
]
```

**3) Add an ```id``` for each task**

Each task must have a unique ```id``` key and value. The baseline tasks must have an ```id``` that contains the string "baseline" to declare which result set to compare to.
Comparator tasks can have any ```id```. If the ```id``` is omitted, one will be generated:


```json
 "freqDist": [
    {
        "merged_baseline_example": [
            {
                "id": "yogi", //                    <-- unique id
                "target": "fb.parent.author.age",
                "threshold": 6,
                "child": {
                    "target": "fb.parent.author.gender",
                    "threshold": 2
                }
            },
            {
                "id": "baseline", //                <-- unique id
                "target": "fb.parent.author.age",
                "threshold": 6,
                "child": {
                    "target": "fb.parent.author.gender",
                    "threshold": 2
                }
            },
        ]
    }
]
```

**4) Define what you wish to baseline**

Using either a ```filter``` and/or a different ```index```, define the tasks accordingly to compare data sets. 

The below example uses a micro targeting approach to compare two products (defined using VEDO tags) within the default index, to the baseline index (note the different ```index``` parameter used to specify a different set of index credentials).

```json
 "freqDist": [
    {
        "merged_baseline_example": [
            {
                "id": "yogi",
                "filter": "interaction.tag_tree.brand == \"yogi\"", // <-- Yogi filter
                "target": "fb.parent.author.age",
                "threshold": 6,
                "child": {
                    "target": "fb.parent.author.gender",
                    "threshold": 2
                }
            },

### Baseline Calculations

When a baseline task is run, by default a CSV result set is generated with the following format:

| id       | category | key    | total_unique_authors | unique_author | probability | index       | expected_baseline |
|----------|----------|--------|----------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| baseline | 25-34    | female | 916900               | 178200        | 0.194350529 | 1           | 178200            |
| baseline | 25-34    | male   | 916900               | 81400         | 0.088777402 | 1           | 81400             |
| yogi     | 25-34    | male   | 1197600              | 237600        | 0.198396794 | 2.234766831 | 106319.8168       |
| yogi     | 25-34    | female | 1197600              | 159900        | 0.133517034 | 0.686990845 | 232754.1935       |
| booboo   | 25-34    | male   | 1971700              | 453300        | 0.229903129 | 2.589658222 | 175042.4038       |
| booboo   | 25-34    | female | 1971700              | 460900        | 0.233757671 | 1.202763236 | 383200.9379       |


* **total_unique_authors**: the total number of unique authors for the id
* **unique_author**: the unique author count for the specific ide, category and key combination
* **probability**: unique_author / total_unique_authors
* **index**: comparator probability / baseline probability
* **expected baseline**: total_unique_authors * baseline probability

With these results, it become simple to plot meaningful visualizations.

## Tableau Workbook Generation

PEPP supports the automated generation of Tableau workbooks. It does this by simply exporting CSV data that a pre-built workbook utilizes for visualizations.

Each workbook is designed based on a specific use case as detailed below. Simply open the required config file and follow any instructions within the header.


| Use Case        | Config File Name           | Explore By  | Description  |
|:------------- |:-------------|:-----|:-----|
| Brand Analytics - Brand Reputation Management | ```BA_brand_reputation_management.js``` | Tags | [Full Details](https://github.com/haganbt/pepp/wiki/Brand%20Reputation%20Management) |
| Content & Media Analytics - - Content Discovery | ```CMA_content_discovery.js``` | Tags | [Full Details](https://github.com/haganbt/pepp/wiki/Content-Discovery) |
| Content & Media Analytics - - Topic Analysis | ```CMA_topic_analysis.js``` | Index | [Full Details](https://github.com/haganbt/pepp/wiki/Topic%20Analysis) |


### Custom Tableau Workbooks

PEPP will automatically check the ```/tableau-templates``` directory for a Tableau workbook (.twb) file with an identical name to that of the config file being executed. If a corresponding workbook is found, it will be copied to the output directory along with the other output files rewriting the directory paths within the workbook accordingly. You can specify to use a template with a different name by using the ```app.template``` property in your config file. (Do not include the .twb extension in this property.)

With this in mind, it then becomes easy to create new custom Tableau workbooks simply by developing a config recipe an associated workbook, and copying the ```.tbx``` file back in to the ```/tableau-templates``` directory. This is especially useful for refreshing data sets.

## Logging

* "warn" : A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
* "info" : Detail on regular operation.
* "debug" : Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
* "trace" : Very detailed application logging.
